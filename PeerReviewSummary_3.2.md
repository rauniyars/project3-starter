## Summary

The author has provided a well-written version of the draft and there are areas to be worked on for improvement but I am pretty sure this is a work in progress. The introduction talks about the existing problems regarding risks and attacks and how that may continue to increase. The author links this fact to introduce the idea for his project and why his project is an important area of research. The introduction section had quite a few terms that a non-technical person might have issues with understanding but the author explains them in a simple language. One can also get a sense of how the author is passionate about the project. The introduction sections also talks about why the author wants to do an SQL Interjection as he aims to understand the potential vulnerabilities of a website. As I was reading through the draft, I was not sure if the author was planning to create a website from scratch and implement his tool so I had to clarify that with him. I suggested that he includes this plan in his introduction section. As for the related section, one can say that the author spent a good time researching scholarly articles and finding how his proposed method can be linked with existing work. There were times where I lost the flow while reading through the Related Work section and one could feel overwhelmed by the amount of information. So I suggested the author to work on creating a logical flow for this section. Next, for the method section, the author mentions some concerns with his proposed idea and hence I believe he should look into more reliable and feasible methods. He also imposes the question of how valuable his findings would be and although it is an important question, mentioning it directly to the reader may create doubts on the project. The author does a great job summarizing his research in the conclusion, however I believe this section is too wordy and I would suggest him to be concise. There are also some grammar issues but they can be excused for now as this is a rough draft. Overall, the research looks very promising and I am sure the final product of this proposed thesis is going to be extremely interesting.
